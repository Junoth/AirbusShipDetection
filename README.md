Airbus Ship Detection Challenge
=

This is a [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection) in kaggle.

The first step in this project is to find whether there is a ship in an image.Secondly,we need to mark the location of ships.
At last,we need to design an interface for users to upload images and dectect ships.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/data) is given in kaggle website.If you have interests,you can go to the website and download it.Labels of train set images are stored in a CSV file.There are **231723** masks in all train images,which means the ship number is also **231723**.

Data process
-
To get the label from the CSV file,we use pandas library to process data.
  import pandas as panda
